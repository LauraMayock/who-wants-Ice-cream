# **_Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock - Portfolio Project 2 - HTML, CSS & Javascript_**
Created by the producers of the hit TV series The Big bang theory as a way for the 2 beloved charactors, Sheldon Cooper and Rajesh Koothrappali to settle a dispute about what to watch on TV. Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a fun twist on the old game of two people using only your hands and some simple rules.

# Objective

The goal is to create an interactive front-end site that provides entertainment for people of all ages. Users will be able to play a fun and entertaining game of Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock against the computer and, after each round, see a clear message on who the winner was and what the deciding factor was.

# User Experience (UX)

## Target Audience
* With its straightforward rules and clear messaging, this game will be accessible to everyone but will be a favourite for those fans of the hit TV show that originated "The big bang theory".


## First time user
As a first-time visitor, I want a clear understanding of the purpose of the page and the ability to use it intuitively with its clear and thought-out design. Although the rules are laid out in the help section, I can delve right in and learn while playing as the deciding factor of each round is displayed.

## Return user
As a returning user, I can enjoy the game on the go or in my leisure time as a fun way to pass the time.

## Site Aims
 * To provide the user with a game that is easy to understand and play. 
 * To offer information on the rules clearly and concisely. 


## Design Wireframes
The innitial goals and scope of the website were worked on and planned using figma. The sturctue and scope of the website differs from the initial planning as i deemed it important to initially approach the project considering all possible feature that would be benificial for both the customer and the user. This provide a good basis for a minimum viable product as well as future add ons. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tp0fcpf/Figma.png" alt="Figma project 2 brainstorm">Hero image</a>

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq:

</details>

## Site Stucture

Consisting of one page, the site has a simple layout. A modal at the top left corner provides a quick outline of the rules. This makes it very convenient to play on the go.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/6s9TBYx/tablet.png" alt="tablet">Tablet</a>

## Design Choices

The simple design makes it user-friendly for all ages and very accessible. To ensure this, I tried to meet as much of the criteria laid out by devtool lighthouse testing. 

### Imagery

My original choice was to use the connection with the popular TV series to make the site appealing to their broad fan base. The image was sourced from [Clip art Key](https://www.clipartkey.com/). But in the end, id decided to use a simple but eye-catching CSS colour-changing background to reach a broader user base.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/1vdTcwJ/Colour-choice.png" alt="Origional game">Origional image</a>


### Colour scheme

My final choice of colours was chosen to compliment the background colours. The simple choice of black and white against the ever changing background colour not only provide accessibiliy but is a blend.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vs62ycr/screen-shot-of-game.png" alt="screen-shot-of-game"></a>

### Typography

I chose two fonts from the google font gallery. Heebo, using the extra bold option for all main text and Moanrope for the Modal text in a lighter weight. I chose Sans- serif as the font family to fall back on if both Heebo and Monrope would still fit in with the feel of the page. I also decided to use [Font Awsome icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons) to make it visually appealing and highlight the traditional hand signs used while playing the game.

# Features

## Favicon
* A favicon has been added as a fun touch and to make the site tap memorable for repeat users.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/hYqGdtP/favicon.png" alt="favicon"></a>

## Title Bar

* In a prominent position, centred at the top of the site, is the game's name. Making it easily recognisable to visitors.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/QC6XVbY/Heading.png" alt="Heading"></a>


## Modal

* Situated in the top left corner of the site is the help section.
* To ensure high accessibility, I added the word help with the recognisable font icon to lead users there if further assistance or explanation is required of the game.
* The modal provides a quick outline of the game's history and its rules.
* For the users easy, not only is there a close button on the modal but if the user clicks outside the modal pop up area the modal will close.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/58DDqNC/Modal-info.png" alt="Modal-info"></a>


## Declaration of winning party

* After each round is played, text will appear below the game name to announce the winner. 
* Each possible outcome had a designated colour to make it quick for the user to recognise the outcome.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/wMPLDkQ/lost-round.png" alt="lost-round"></a>

## Scoreboard

* On the left is the player's score, which increases after each player win.
* The right shows the computer's score, which also updates after each win.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/JrRTnXB/scoreboard.png" alt="scoreboard"></a>

## Player v Computer 

* The left box shows the player's chosen hand, and on the right, the computers. 
* This gives for easy comparison.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/VTtfb4Q/display.png" alt="display"></a>

## Round decider

* After each round, the deciding factor based on the game's rules is also shown.
* Its also great for new users as they can learn the rules of the game as they play.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/2yqz2Lc/rule2.png" alt="rule2"></a>


## Players choices

* Layed out at the bottom of the game are the moves the player can choose to play. Rock, Paper,     Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
* When the player chooses a play, this triggers an automated random play from the computer.
* Using the written word and a Font Awesome icon to represent it helps the user learn the hand movements usually associated with the game. It also ensures accessibility is being met to the highest of standards.
* Each button also has a hoover element for users benefit.

# Future Features

* I think that having the choice to either play as is or by rounds of 5 or 10 would provide the user with an opportunity to share their high score or wins on social media and guarantee return and new visitors.

* As I have gone to such lengths to ensure the site's accessibility, I think the implintation of sound cues and effects would be a great add-on.

* Currently, the site is responsive and recommended to play in portrait. Given more time, I would have liked to work on a smartphone landscape view for users' preferences.


# Technologies used

* HTML5 - Provides the sturcture and content for the website.
* CSS3 - Provides the styling for the website.
* JavaScript - To build and interative game, for the user to actively enage with data.
* Google Chrome DevTools - Used to debug and test responsiveness of the site.
* gitpod - Used to develop website.
* GitBash - Used to push repository to Github.
* Github - Used host and deploy website.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/P6FBqNn/w3-HTML-validation-tool.png" alt="w3-HTML-validation-tool"></a>

* JavaScript was tested using [Beautifytools](https://beautifytools.com/javascript-validator.php)

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/B2TvjDx/beautifytools-javascript-validator.png" alt="beautifytools-javascript-validator"></a>

# Accessibility Testing

## Lighthouse Testing

* My origional design choices proved to cause quite a few accessibility issues.

<a href="https://ibb.co/H7Wpm8c"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/F6SqGTQ/lighthouse-testing-Acessibility-buttons.png" alt="lighthouse-testing-Acessibility-buttons"></a>

* For aesthetic purposes, I initially decided to use only the font awesome icons to represent each player's move choices. This raised an error with on lighthouse.
* The choice of adding the written word and the font awesome icon meant that it was more user-friendly for people with impairment but also new users to the game.
 

<a href="https://ibb.co/8P39wrq"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/SVTBgtb/lighthouse-testing-Acessibility-modal-button.png" alt="lighthouse-testing-Acessibility-modal-button"></a>

* It also adivse that the colour choice had a low contrast issue which i rectified.


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/fNzPxD8/light-house-results-after-amendments.png" alt="light-house-results-after-amendments"></a>

* Lighthouse test results after my changes.

<a href="https://ibb.co/Wz4Y2VD"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fNzPxD8/light-house-results-after-amendments.png" alt="light-house-results-after-amendments"></a>

 
## Manual Testing

* I have tested that this page works in the following browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari and FireFox.
* I tested responsiveness in portrait form using the inspect function on google chrome, and it is recommended to play in this position. 
* I tested that the text is readable in all website areas and that each round decider shows as required in the right circumstances.

## Bugs Fixed

* Below are screen shots of some of the issues highlighted by devtools. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bKGG1Hx/devtools-bug-javascript-link.png" alt="devtools-bug-javascript-link"></a>

* One of the above issues was a simple error with the link between the JavaScript page and HTML and was rectified easily.

* The second was highlighting an issue finding a Favicon. This was due to pre-saved software by Code Institue. When I installed a Favicon onto the site, it created another error because I had followed the steps on the Favicon website on how to install it, not knowing that this step was already preloaded.

* Issue with Modal

<a href="https://ibb.co/TTBMtH0"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/cvchQN8/devtools-bugs-modal-issue.png" alt="devtools-bugs-modal-issue" border="0"></a>

* This was due to the fact that i did not create a getElement between the modal button and Javascript. I did with the Modal itself but didnt recognise that it was needed for both.

* Show icon not defined

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bsN96H8/devtools-bugs.png" alt="devtools-bugs"></a>

* The above error was caused by me not defining the element before using it in a function.

* The Favicon shown in the above image is the same issue discussed above.

* I used a seprate gitpod work space to work through and test code before implimenting it. This help grately to ensure that I didnt break any of the functions that I proviously implimended. 

* I aimed to add an option to play a round of 5 or 10 and then for the game to end showing an overall winner, but this caused a lot of issues, and due to time constraints, it had to be left for a future feature.
