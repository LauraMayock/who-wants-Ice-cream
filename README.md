# Objective

The goal is to create an interactive site that used a terminal that allows the user to go thourgh the process of ordering an ice-cream as they would if they were in an ice-cream shop.

# User Experience (UX)

## User
* As a user, I want a clear understanding of the purpose of the page and the ability to use it intuitively with its clear and thought-out design. 
* To have a clear layout and a clear understanding of what information is expected of me.
* To be prompted if my input is invalid. 

## User Stories
* As a user, I want a simple and interactive way to order my favourite ice-cream.
* I want clear guidance throughout.
* I want a receipt with my purchase. Giving a clear outline of my purchase and the cost.


## Flow Chart
Using the website [lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) The flow chart below gives a simplified layout of what I was hoping to achieve. The shapes highlighted by the yellow colour show the stages where the user will be asked for simple input. the red boxes symbolise the negative input or an invalid input. While the green shows a positive response from the user.

# Features

## Header
* Using [Patorjk](https://patorjk.com/) i created a simple logo for the shop.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/y6wJZQH/logo.png" alt="logo"></a>

## Title Bar

* In a prominent position, centred at the top of the site, is the game's name. Making it easily recognisable to visitors.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/QC6XVbY/Heading.png" alt="Heading"></a>


## Modal

* Situated in the top left corner of the site is the help section.
* To ensure high accessibility, I added the word help with the recognisable font icon to lead users there if further assistance or explanation is required of the game.
* The modal provides a quick outline of the game's history and its rules.
* For the users easy, not only is there a close button on the modal but if the user clicks outside the modal pop up area the modal will close.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/58DDqNC/Modal-info.png" alt="Modal-info"></a>


## Declaration of winning party

* After each round is played, text will appear below the game name to announce the winner. 
* Each possible outcome had a designated colour to make it quick for the user to recognise the outcome.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/mTkzN2Z/winning-round.png" alt="winning-round"></a>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/wMPLDkQ/lost-round.png" alt="lost-round"></a>

## Scoreboard

* On the left is the player's score, which increases after each player win.
* The right shows the computer's score, which also updates after each win.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/JrRTnXB/scoreboard.png" alt="scoreboard"></a>

## Player v Computer 

* The left box shows the player's chosen hand, and on the right, the computers. 
* This gives for easy comparison.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/VTtfb4Q/display.png" alt="display"></a>

## Round decider

* After each round, the deciding factor based on the game's rules is also shown.
* Its also great for new users as they can learn the rules of the game as they play.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/2yqz2Lc/rule2.png" alt="rule2"></a>


## Players choices

* Layed out at the bottom of the game are the moves the player can choose to play. Rock, Paper,     Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
* When the player chooses a play, this triggers an automated random play from the computer.
* Using the written word and a Font Awesome icon to represent it helps the user learn the hand movements usually associated with the game. It also ensures accessibility is being met to the highest of standards.
* Each button also has a hoover element for users benefit.

# Future Features

* I think that having the choice to either play as is or by rounds of 5 or 10 would provide the user with an opportunity to share their high score or wins on social media and guarantee return and new visitors.

* As I have gone to such lengths to ensure the site's accessibility, I think the implintation of sound cues and effects would be a great add-on.

* Currently, the site is responsive and recommended to play in portrait. Given more time, I would have liked to work on a smartphone landscape view for users' preferences.


# Technologies used

* HTML5 - Provides the sturcture and content for the website.
* CSS3 - Provides the styling for the website.
* JavaScript - To build and interative game, for the user to actively enage with data.
* Google Chrome DevTools - Used to debug and test responsiveness of the site.
* gitpod - Used to develop website.
* GitBash - Used to push repository to Github.
* Github - Used host and deploy website.

# Testing

## Code Validation

* Both the CSS and HTML code was tested using W3 validation services. Each test came back with no issues highlighted.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/P6FBqNn/w3-HTML-validation-tool.png" alt="w3-HTML-validation-tool"></a>

* JavaScript was tested using [Beautifytools](https://beautifytools.com/javascript-validator.php)

# Accessibility Testing

## Lighthouse Testing

* My origional design choices proved to cause quite a few accessibility issues.

<a href="https://ibb.co/H7Wpm8c"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/F6SqGTQ/lighthouse-testing-Acessibility-buttons.png" alt="lighthouse-testing-Acessibility-buttons"></a>

* For aesthetic purposes, I initially decided to use only the font awesome icons to represent each player's move choices. This raised an error with on lighthouse.
* The choice of adding the written word and the font awesome icon meant that it was more user-friendly for people with impairment but also new users to the game.
 

<a href="https://ibb.co/8P39wrq"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/SVTBgtb/lighthouse-testing-Acessibility-modal-button.png" alt="lighthouse-testing-Acessibility-modal-button"></a>

* It also adivse that the colour choice had a low contrast issue which i rectified.


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/fNzPxD8/light-house-results-after-amendments.png" alt="light-house-results-after-amendments"></a>

* Lighthouse test results after my changes.

<a href="https://ibb.co/Wz4Y2VD"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fNzPxD8/light-house-results-after-amendments.png" alt="light-house-results-after-amendments"></a>

 
## Manual Testing

* I have tested that this page works in the following browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari and FireFox.
* I tested responsiveness in portrait form using the inspect function on google chrome, and it is recommended to play in this position. 
* I tested that the text is readable in all website areas and that each round decider shows as required in the right circumstances.

## Bugs Fixed

* Below are screen shots of some of the issues highlighted by devtools. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bKGG1Hx/devtools-bug-javascript-link.png" alt="devtools-bug-javascript-link"></a>

* One of the above issues was a simple error with the link between the JavaScript page and HTML and was rectified easily.

* The second was highlighting an issue finding a Favicon. This was due to pre-saved software by Code Institue. When I installed a Favicon onto the site, it created another error because I had followed the steps on the Favicon website on how to install it, not knowing that this step was already preloaded.

* Issue with Modal

<a href="https://ibb.co/TTBMtH0"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/cvchQN8/devtools-bugs-modal-issue.png" alt="devtools-bugs-modal-issue" border="0"></a>

* This was due to the fact that i did not create a getElement between the modal button and Javascript. I did with the Modal itself but didnt recognise that it was needed for both.

* Show icon not defined

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bsN96H8/devtools-bugs.png" alt="devtools-bugs"></a>

* The above error was caused by me not defining the element before using it in a function.

* The Favicon shown in the above image is the same issue discussed above.

* I used a seprate gitpod work space to work through and test code before implimenting it. This help grately to ensure that I didnt break any of the functions that I proviously implimended. 

* I aimed to add an option to play a round of 5 or 10 and then for the game to end showing an overall winner, but this caused a lot of issues, and due to time constraints, it had to be left for a future feature.

# Deployment

Before you deploy to Heroku, make sure to update any dependencies needed to run your app. A list of dependencies can be saved in the requirements.txt file. This is done automatically after adding the below code into the terminal and then do a git push. 

pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

1. Navigate to Heroku website and either sign in or click sign up to create a new account.

2. In your account dashboard click the Create new APP button.

3. Add a name for APP in the APP-Name field.

4. Select your region from the drop-down menu and click on Create APP button.

5. On the next page click on the Settings tab to adjust the settings.

6. Click on the "config vars" button and hide any sensitive files from being deployed.
